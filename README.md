We have created Task app for users who want to manage their work with efficiency.
To create a profile, the user need to have unique email which will be then assiociated with his account.
After the user has created their profile, he will receive a welcome email.
He will be then able to create, edit, remove tasks or files. Make changes in his account including avatar.
He can log out, delete as per his convinience with a goodbye email from the app.

With MongoDB as our main database and mongoose being our object data modeling (ODM) library, we have used a variety of NPM modules to manage our REST API.
